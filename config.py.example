# Set to true to enable removal of proxy's under hosts. Use with caution and make sure that you specified

## Hostgroup mapping
# Available choices: dev_location, dev_role, manufacturer, region, site, site_group, tenant, tenant_group
# You can also use CF (custom field) names under the device. The CF content will be used for the hostgroup generation.
#
# When using region in the group name, the default behaviour is to use name of the directly assigned region.
# By setting traverse_regions to True the full path of all parent regions will be used in the hostgroup, e.g.:
#
# 'Global/Europe/Netherlands/Amsterdam' instead of just 'Amsterdam'.
#
# traverse_site_groups controls the same behaviour for any assigned site_groups.

## Filtering
# Custom device filter, variable must be present but can be left empty with no filtering.
# A couple of examples:
#  nb_device_filter = {} #No filter
#  nb_device_filter = {"tag": "zabbix"} #Use a tag
#  nb_device_filter = {"site": "HQ-AMS"} #Use a site name
#  nb_device_filter = {"site": ["HQ-AMS", "HQ-FRA"]} #Device must be in either one of these sites
#  nb_device_filter = {"site": "HQ-AMS", "tag": "zabbix", "role__n": ["PDU", "console-server"]} #Device must be in site HQ-AMS, have the tag zabbix and must not be part of the PDU or console-server role

# Default device filter, only get devices which have a name in Netbox:
nb_device_filter = {"name__n": "null"}
